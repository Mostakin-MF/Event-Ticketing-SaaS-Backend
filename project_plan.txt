Event Ticketing and Management SaaS Platform — Project Plan
Project: Advanced Web Tech - Event Ticketing SaaS Platform

Owner: <your name>
Created: 2025-10-20
Updated: 2025-01-27

1) Vision / Goal
- Build a multi-tenant event ticketing SaaS platform with Next.js (frontend) and NestJS (backend), using PostgreSQL with TypeORM. Prioritize clean architecture, DX, performance (SSR/ISR), and a clear separation between UI and API layers.
- Focus on event organizers creating public event pages, selling tickets, processing payments, and handling attendee check-in via QR codes.

2) High-Level Requirements
- Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation per organizer
- User auth (JWT in HttpOnly cookies) with role-based access (owner/admin/staff)
- Public event pages (SSR/ISR) and authenticated organizer portal (CSR)
- Event management, ticket types, inventory management
- Secure checkout and payment processing
- QR code generation and mobile check-in system
- Sales dashboard and reporting with CSV export
- Email notifications for tickets and confirmations

3) Scope (In / Out)
- In: Next.js app, NestJS REST API, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, Docker Compose for local DB, lint/format, basic CI, payment integration (Stripe), email service
- Out: Advanced microservices, real-time websockets (for now), cloud infra IaC (initially), advanced features like reserved seating (V2)

4) Tech Stack (Current Implementation)
- Frontend: Next.js 16.0.0 (TypeScript, App Router), Tailwind CSS 4.0, React 19.2.0, Axios for data fetching
- Backend: NestJS 11.0.1 (TypeScript), REST API, class-validator/transformer, TypeORM (to be added)
- Database: PostgreSQL (to be configured)
- DevOps/Hosting: Docker Compose (local Postgres+Adminer), Vercel (web) + Render/Railway/Fly (API) [TBD]

5) Current Project Status (as of 2025-01-27)
- ✅ Basic Next.js frontend scaffolded (App Router, Tailwind CSS 4.0, TypeScript)
- ✅ Basic NestJS backend scaffolded (v11.0.1, TypeScript, Express platform)
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier configured for both frontend and backend
- ✅ Basic project structure established
- ❌ Database connection not yet configured
- ❌ TypeORM not yet installed/configured
- ❌ Authentication system not implemented
- ❌ Event ticketing domain models not created
- ❌ Payment integration not implemented
- ❌ Email service not configured

6) Next Priority Tasks (Updated)
- [ ] Install and configure TypeORM with PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set up Docker Compose with PostgreSQL + Adminer
- [ ] Create database entities for event ticketing (Tenant, User, Event, TicketType, Order, Ticket)
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication with role-based access control
- [ ] Create basic CRUD APIs for events and ticket management
- [ ] Set up Axios in frontend for API communication
- [ ] Implement multi-tenant data isolation
- [ ] Add Stripe payment integration
- [ ] Set up email service for ticket delivery
- [ ] Create QR code generation and validation system

7) Technical Architecture Decisions
- ✅ Frontend: Next.js 16.0.0 with App Router (confirmed)
- ✅ Backend: NestJS 11.0.1 with TypeScript (confirmed)
- ✅ Styling: Tailwind CSS 4.0 (confirmed)
- ✅ Data Fetching: Axios (confirmed)
- ✅ Database: PostgreSQL with TypeORM (confirmed)
- ✅ Authentication: JWT in HttpOnly cookies (confirmed)
- 🔄 Payment Provider: Stripe (to be implemented)
- 🔄 Email Service: TBD (SendGrid/AWS SES)

8) Open Questions / Decisions
- Q: Hosting choice for API (Render/Railway/Fly)?
- Q: Email service provider (SendGrid vs AWS SES vs Resend)?
- Q: QR code library choice (qrcode vs react-qr-code)?
- Decision: Multi-tenant architecture with row-level tenancy using tenant_id

9) Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Payment integration complexity
- Mitigation: Start with Stripe test mode, robust webhook handling
- Risk: Multi-tenant data isolation bugs
- Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, tenant scoping in all queries
- Risk: QR code security vulnerabilities
- Mitigation: Signed payloads, one-scan rule enforcement

10) Project Structure
- Current: Separate `frontend/` and `backend/` directories
- Future: Consider monorepo structure with shared types
- Database: PostgreSQL with TypeORM entities
- API: RESTful endpoints with DTOs and validation
